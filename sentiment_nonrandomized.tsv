445	-1	So in the end, we see what this alleged controversy about #EileenGu is really about: the equating of the United States with whiteness and the disbelief that anyone might choose the complexities of their own identity over a commitment to blind allegiance. 6/6
446	-1	When the critics pivot to #UyghurGenocide as a reason that #EileenGu should not have chosen to compete for China, they put a standard on her that is not applied evenly. It would be ideal if every athlete used their platform to criticize abuses of power in their own nation. 4/6
447	-1	This is a hallmark of white supremacy culture. Why would #EileenGu or anyone -- they would ask -- who enjoys such proximity to whiteness choose to step away from it and claim their Chinese heritage and identity over their American one? 2/6
448	0	People are saying #EileenGu is disloyal to the nation who raised her and provided her with an opportunity to be in the #Olympics. What rankles these people the most is not only that she is competing for China, but that she is doing so as a person with a white American father. 1/6
